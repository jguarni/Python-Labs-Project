# By running the expressions in the idle shell it outputs the result
# of the single expression in the running shell. By placing these expressions
# in a new python program they will still calculate correctly because the syntax
# and math is correct, but the program needs to know what to do with this information.
# This is why the print command is used, which outputs the answers of the expressions
# to the user in a readable format.


print((4/2)+(2/4))
print(4/2+2/4)
